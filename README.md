### a.	Data Acquisition:
Motion sensors are used to collect data from the smartphone during the data acquisition stage, including angle, vibration, rotation, and oscillation. The individual activities are either linked to the actual environment where the device is positioned or are reflected in the sensor data. Therefore, selecting the right sensors is essential. HAD systems can identify patterns in sensor signals and link them to activities like sports and activities of daily life (ADL) by combining accelerometer and gyroscope data.
### b.	Pre-processing and Segmentation:
After data capture, the motion sensor data must be processed, converted to a readable format, and segmented in order to be used in subsequent HAD application stages. The raw data obtained by motion sensors may also contain sounds. In the segmentation phase, the continuously recorded signals are divided into more manageable chunks. By selecting smaller segments, it is possible to detect actions more quickly because there is a shorter wait time to mount the segment and a lower demand for resources. Larger segments enable the recognition of more complicated operations, but the segment's assembly and processing will take more time. The HAD community has employed a variety of segment sizes in the literature, with a recognition rate of over 90% and segment sizes ranging from 1 s to 10 s.
### c.	Feature Extraction Process:
Finding a high-level representation from each activity segment is the goal of the feature extraction step. Because there is inter-activity similarity, feature extraction for sensor-based activity detection is more challenging. There may be similarities among many activities (e.g., walking and running). As a result, it is challenging to create distinctive elements to represent activities separately. Many HAD systems are built on flimsy foundations. A domain expert handcrafts the features that create a high-level representation from the sensor data.
### d.	Human Activity Classification:
When making judgments under uncertainty, a machine learning method can be used to automatically find patterns in a dataset. Decision trees, naive Bayes, support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN), logistic regression, and KNN are a few examples of supervised learning algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbors). Since machine learning models do not perform well when used directly on raw data, it is crucial for these methods that the sensor data be transformed into a high-level representation. The classification procedure is used to evaluate how well the trained machine learning algorithm is doing.
### e.	Evaluation for HAD Systems:
The most popular evaluation measures to predict a classifier's future performance. Accuracy, recall (sensitivity), specificity, precision, and F-measure are the evaluation metrics that are frequently employed in the literature on smartphone-based HAD. The most common HAD metric, accuracy, is determined by dividing the total number of activities by the number of activities that were successfully identified.
### f.	Data Collection and Preprocessing:
This project requires a dataset that is acquired through mobile sensors that can be utilized for training the model for real-time activity classification. The real-time signals can then be classified by measuring the distance from the already collected and categorized group of signals. The signals may need to be normalized, smoothed, or cleaned for processing further. 	Sensor (accelerometer, gyroscope, orientation) 
Accelerometer formula: R^2 Rx^2+ Ry^2+ Rz^2
Gyroscope formula: Rxz^2 = Rx^2 + Rz^2
                                 Ryz^2 = Ry^2 + Rz^2
Orientation formula: (yb - ya)(xc - xb) - (yc  - yb)(xb - xa)
### g.	Decision Tree Classifier:
Decision trees employ a tree-like structure to represent decisions in a common machine learning model. They are built using metrics such as information and Gini impurity in a top-down manner. In order to divide the elements into homogeneous subsets, it determines the relative value of each attribute. The leaf nodes reflect the decision or the anticipated outcome, whereas the nodes represent the split's condition. One of the output variables is directly connected to the tree's branches or edges. Models for classification and regression issues use decision trees. Even while the decision tree is simple to understand, it has a tendency to overfit because it keeps splitting up into characteristics and critically trains using training data. The decision tree is typically pruned to prevent overfitting and prevent it from becoming too deep. Therefore, we employ this approach in our model to assess the accuracy of our forecast; the result is 90% accurate.
### h.	Training the Model:
The most crucial phase of machine learning is training. To detect patterns and generate predictions, you feed your machine learning model the prepared data during training. As a result, the model gains knowledge from the data to complete the given task. The model improves in prediction over time with training.
### i.	Feature Detection:
This module is responsible for the detection of features through the sensor. The signal values obtained through the sensor can be used for detecting specific patterns in the input. 
### j.	Classification of Activity:
This module is in charge of classifying the activity into a number of groups. A set of classes must first be educated into a machine learning model. Check to determine whether the models' accuracy may be increased in any manner after reviewing them. This is accomplished by fine-tuning the model's parameter settings. The model's parameters are the variables that are typically chosen by the programmer. The accuracy will be at its highest at a specific parameter value. Finding these settings is referred to as parameter tweaking. The model will then be imported into the mobile application's backend, which can label an unidentified sample among a group of classes.
